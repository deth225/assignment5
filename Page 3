     <span class="starting-text">Resources for Members:</span> An important component of the #IAmAWomanInSTEM initiative is gathering resources that are research-based and available via the Internet as open access learning objects for sharing and reuse.

   <div class="box-two">
     <span class="starting-text">Lorem ipsum</span> An important component of the initiative is for our student ambassadors to take on leadership roles. There are no formal requirements but all who signed up to be a part of the initiative are expected to come up with their own way of providing a leadership role in raising awareness on campus and beyond regarding the issues involved in persisting and succeeding as a woman in STEM fields. There are important ways by which to examine the kinds of leadership efforts undertaken with #IAmAWomanInSTEM service projects; and, we rely on the AAC&U's Civic Engagement VALUE Rubric (download .pdf here) to evaluate whether a contribution to the initiative enriches both personally and publicly and is socially beneficial to our community.
